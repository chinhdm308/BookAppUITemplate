    <string name="lorem_text">Our lab is interested in defining the role of innate immunity in homeostasis, repair, and disease in the respiratory tract, where environmental determinants play a key role in both immunopathogenesis and health. Using biochemical, molecular, and genomic approaches, we focus on the cellular and molecular networks underlying the initiation and persistence of type 2 immunity at mucosal sites. Our ultimate goal is to understand innate immune sensing in the respiratory tract and key regulatory features that may treat or prevent diseases such as asthma.</string>
